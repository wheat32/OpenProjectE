 * We *don't* use our own container type here. The only thing we do differently is the interact check and that only applies serverside. So just a inheritor class is
 * enough, the packet/gui clientside can all use vanilla's stuff.
 *
 * Note: We require an {@link IWorldPosCallable} so that the {@link WorkbenchContainer} can properly perform things like the crafting matrix changing. We override
 * canInteractWith however, so that even if the player is moving while being in the crafting grid, they continue to be able to access it.
